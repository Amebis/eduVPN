# Installation and updating of eduVPN Clients for Windows

eduVPN, Let's Connect! and govVPN clients are the same client targeted for a different audience. While their UI is different, the setup is identical. Therefore, the remainder of this document will reference "eduVPN" only for readability.

## Setup

Download and run the EXE installer. Binaries are published [here](https://github.com/Amebis/eduVPN/releases).

## Update

A self-updating feature has been introduced beginning with version 1.0.11. You should be prompted to update when a new version is available on client startup.

To update manually, perform the following steps:
1. Exit eduVPN client if running.
2. Perform setup. No need to uninstall the previous version first.
